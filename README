This is a spring boot based demo project for searching IMDb top 1000 movies.
You can build it using the maven wrapper mvnw, 
mvnw -U clean install

then run the jar file which will be a command like
java -jar .\target\IMDbSearch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar



The most important assumption that this project makes is those on how to read data from the
IMDb site. It parses the sites raw HTML and relies on particular class names. 
For reading Director, writer, and cast details it relies on these three items being
the first 3 tables of the IMDb /fullcredits page. There didnt seem to be a consistent 
way to identify this information otherwise. I also treat store directors, writers, and cast
in the same table of the database and only make the distinguish them by their listed contribution
in the movie 

If I spent more time improving this. I would improve the information that I provide in search results.
I would include elements like ratings, director/writer/ and cast lists. I would like to indicate if the movie
can be found free online from popular sites or if its available in amazon prime or hulu. I would let the user 
perform more complicated searches that could union or intersect movies with keywords. They would be able to filter
by attributes like ranking, availability and date. I would separate the database out of the program 
and put the site parsing code in an AWS lambda function which would spawn many functions to 
read data for each movie. This would shorten its runtime and not impact the server when updating
data. I could also log link clicks coming form search results and use that to determine movie relevance to
keyword search.
